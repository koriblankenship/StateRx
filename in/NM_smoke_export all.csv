The fire is being managed by the Cuba Ranger District (Santa Fe NF) as a response to wildland fire confinement - a suppression objective with a confinement strategy. As of today, July 9, 2009; a total of 66 acres have been consumed.  The fire is bounded by Forest Service System roads.  The total number of acres that are possible to be consumed is 750.  This is NOT to say that we plan on burning that many acres; 750 acres represents the total number of acres found within the primary Jacquez Fire planning unit, thus the fire can grow no larger than 750 acres. It was this total number of potential acres that I used to calculate the fuel loading questions found earlier in this form.  Please call if you have any questions,    Tom",,"Excellent, Fair, Good, Poor, Very Good",,"Santa Fe NF Information Officer has been issuing press releases, and will continue to update.

We did fill out the visual tracking form for that day and so it is included in this final documenetation. No complaints were received on this day and ignitions took place between 10 am and 2 pm. Burning on this day and in fact the 2 days surrounding this date resulted in fast burning piles with residual smoke being minial at the time of leaving for the day and consumption being over 70% at this time.

All useable portions of merchanatable trees are turned into sawlogs or post logs and removed from site.

Smaller subdivisions are located between Ruidoso and the burn unit to the SW the closest being Raches of Sonterra that is within 1.5 miles W of the burn area. The White Mountain Wilderness Area is located 7 miles WSW of the burn area and is not likely to receive any impacts from smoke. Sierra Blanca airport is located 1.5 miles to the SE of the burn unit. Burning is scheduled to be conducted when snow or moisture is or has been received in the area. This allows piles to be burned down with minimal chance for escape. Roads are signed entering into the project area with control burn signs and public notifications are made through the media. Piles have cured for 1 seasons. All 1000 hr fuels and larger have been removed. Piles consist of 100 hr fuels or smaller. Piles are covered. Fuel loading was estimated by pile size 48"" x 8' x 8' = 3072 in. div/12 = 256 cf per pile x 15 piles per acre x 75 acres.

This will dramatically reduce smoke impacts and burning on these days can occur with a fair or better ventilation category.
